# SPH-Fluid-WebGL

Just playing around in WebGL with our old project that was originally made in C++/OpenGL. The Navier-Stokes equations were just rewritten into Javascript with no optimization at all, 100% brute forced. 

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/RiiQQe/Modelleringsprojekt.git).
